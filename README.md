# Southern United States Health Data Public Repository
This is a repository examining county-based public health data across the Southern-Eastern region of the United States. 

The repository contains:
1. CSV. file with data collected from individual counties across the United States
2. CSV. file sample repository contain an aggregate of public health data from the southern region of the United States
3. Two Jupyter Labs tutorials on using pandas
4. A graphical representation of the data

## Sources of Data
The data in this repository is sourced from [Dr. Gotzler](https://englishcomplit.unc.edu/faculty-directory/steven-gotzler/), and [the Davis Library Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) at the University of North Carolina. Dr. Gotzler adapted the included tutorials from resources developed by staff at UNC's Davis Library's Research Hub. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is to support public health researchers examine health outcomes across the South at the county and state levels. More specifically, it compares the variables of the average number of poor mental health days per resident, what percent of the population has "poor" or "fair" health, and the average yearly out-of-pocket spending on healthcare. 

## Potential 
This repository exists to explore public health data across different counties and states in the South. Researchers might utilize it in the comparison of healthcare policies. They can also use it to study health inequalities across the region. In this respect, they can examine counties across a state or compare state by state. They may also use the data to see if there is a correlation between variables. 

# Data Visualization
The graph included below, comparing healthcare variables by states in the South, visualizes the repository's three experimental variables across states in the South.
