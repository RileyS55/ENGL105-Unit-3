# Southern United States Health Data Public Repository
This is a repository containing county-based public health data, and a sample repository for Dr. Gotlzer's Fall 2022 ENGL-105 Sect. 014, at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

The repository contains:
1. CSV. file with data collected from individual counties across the United States
2. CSV. file sample repository contain an aggregate of public health data from the southern region of the United States
3. Two Jupyter Labs tutorials
4. Graphical representation of data

## Source of Data
The data in this repository is sourced from [the Davis Library Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) at the University of North Carolina, and Dr. Gotzler. 

The Southern United States Health Data Public Repository provides data on health-related issues in counties across the South. Specifically, it compares the variables of the average number of poor mental health days per resident, what percent of the population has "poor" or "fair" health, and the average yearly out-of-pocket spending on healthcare.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is to explore public health data from the Southern Region of the United States.

## Potential 
This repository has the potential to explore public health data across different counties. It can assist the comparative analysis of health care outcomes, costs, and access.

### Data Visualization
The graph included below, comparing healthcare variables by states in the South, demonstrates the repository's potential.
