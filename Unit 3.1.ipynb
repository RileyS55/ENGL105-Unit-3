    "# Health Data Set for the Southern Region of the United States\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Southern Health Data Set is to examine several relevant health care variables across the Southern region of the United States. Specifically, it compiles the average number of poor mental health days, the percentage of people with poor or fair health, and health care costs across different counties. It also shows which states the counties are in to aid in comparing outcomes across the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you the steps to reproduce `SO_HealthDataSet.csv`. Its data comes from the `CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv`, which provides county-based healthcare statistics across the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several major steps to recreate the \"Southern Health Data Set.\" Over the tutorial, you will;\n",
    "1. Create a data frame from `CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv`\n",
    "2. Isolate the data from the south\n",
    "3. Extract only the required variables\n",
    "4. Convert that data into a new csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides having access to Jupyter labs, to reproduce this data set you will also need to have [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/) installed.\n",

    "You also need to download the [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4844/assignments/96397?module_item_id=188006).\n",
